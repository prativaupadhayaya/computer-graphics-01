Digital differential analyzer (DDA) is used for linear interpolation of variables over an interval between 
given start, end points and for rasterization of lines, triangles and polygons.
Using DDA Algorithm, Write a C-Program to draw a line segment between two given points.
Aim: To implement DDA Algorithm for drawing a line segment between two given end points A (x1, y1)
and B(x2, y2).
Description: DDA algorithm is an incremental scan conversion method. Here we perform calculations 
at each step using the results from the preceding step. The characteristic of the DDA algorithm is to take 
unit steps along one coordinate and compute the corresponding values along the other coordinate. The 
unit steps are always along the coordinate of greatest change, e.g. if dx = 10 and dy = 5, then we would 
take unit steps along x and compute the steps along y.
In DDA we need to consider two cases;
One is slope of the line less than or equal to one (|m| ≤1) and slope of the line greater than one (m|> 1).
1) When |m| ≤ 1 means y2-y1 = x2-x1 or y2-y1 <x2-x1.In both these cases we assume x to be the major
axis. Therefore we sample x axis at unit intervals and find the y values corresponding to each x value. 
We have the slope equation as
∆ y = m ∆ x
y2-y1 = m (x2-x1)
In general terms we can say that y i+1 - yi = m(x i+1 - xi ). But here ∆ x = 1; therefore the equation
reduces to y i+1= yi + m = yi + dy/dx.
2) When | m| > 1 means y2-y1> x2-x1 and therefore we assume y to be the major axis. Here we sample 
y axis at unit intervals and find the x values corresponding to each y value. We have the slope
equation as
Algorithm:
1. Start.
∆ y = m ∆ x
y2-y1 = m (x2-x1)
2. Declare variables x,y,x1,y1,x2,y2,k,dx,dy,s,xi,yi and also declare 
gdriver=DETECT, mode.
3. Initialize the graphic mode with the path location in TurboC3 folder.
4. Input the two line end-points and store the left end-points in (x1,y1).
5. Load (x1, y1) into the frame buffer; that is, plot the first point. put x=x1,y=y1.
6. Calculate dx=x2-x1 and dy=y2-y1.
7. If abs (dx) > abs (dy), do s=abs(dx).
8. Otherwise s= abs(dy).
9. Then xi=dx/s and yi=dy/s.
10. Start from k=0 and continuing till k<s,the points will be 
i. x=x+xi.
ii. Y=y+yi.
11. Plot pixels using putpixel at points (x,y) in specified colour.
12. Close Graph and stop.
