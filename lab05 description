. Introduction
In computer graphics, an ellipse is drawn on a raster display by plotting pixels that best approximate the mathematical shape. Since displays work with discrete pixels, special algorithms are used to efficiently generate ellipses using integer arithmetic and symmetry.
The most commonly used algorithm is the Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm.

Algorithm:

1. Input r xx ry, and ellipse center (x_{c}, y_{c}) and obtain the first point on an ellipse centered on the origin as

(x_{0}, y_{0}) = (0, r_{y})

2. Calculate the initial parameter in region 1 as p1 0 = r_{y} ^ 2 - r_{x} ^ 2 * r_{y} + 1/4 * r_{x} ^ 2

3. At each x_{1} position, starting at i = 0 if p1 i < 0 , the next point along the ellipse centered on (0, 0) is (x_{i} + 1, y_{i}) and p1 i+1 =p1 i + 2r ^ 2 x y i+1 y

Otherwise, the next point is (x_{i} + 1, y_{i} - 1) and and continue until p^ 1 i+1 = p^ 1 i + 2r_{y} ^ 2 x i+1 -2 r x ^ 2 y i+1 +r y ^ 2 2r_{y} ^ 2 * x >= 2r_{x} ^ 2 * y

4. (x_{0}, y_{0}) is the last position calculated in region 1. Calculate the initial parameter in region 2 as p 2 0 = r_{y} ^ 2 * (x_{0} + 1/2) ^ 2 + r_{x} ^ 2 * (y_{0} - 1) ^ 2 - r_{x} ^ 2 * r_{y} ^ 2

5. At each y_{i} position, starting at i = 0 if p2 i > 0 , the next point along the ellipse centered on (0,

0) is (x_{i}, y_{i} - 1) and P^ 2 i+1 = p_{i} - 2r ^ 2 &y&+r^ 2 \\ x&&x matrix

Otherwise, the next point is (x_{i} + 1, y_{i} - 1) and p 2 i+1 =p 2 i + 2r_{y} ^ 2 x i+1 -2 r x ^ 2 y i+1 +r x ^ 2

Use the same incremental calculations as in region 1. Continue until y = 0

6. For both regions determine symmetry points in the other three quadrants.

7. Move each calculated pixel position (x, y) onto the elliptical path centered on ( x ,y c ); and plot the coordinate values

x = x + x_{c} , y = y + y_{c}
